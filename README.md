# dym2149-oric-mixer
Oric mixer board for [Dual YM2149 synth](https://github.com/bderleta/dym2149-board). 
Loosely based on [Oric Atmos schematic](https://www.986-studio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/OricSchematics.pdf). Can be used as a kind of reference for creating own mixers.

Beware: Capacitor values and footprints are wrong!
